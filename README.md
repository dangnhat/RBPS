Remote Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Monitoring System

ABSTRACT
Hypertension is called “silent killer” as it leads to many dangerous hypertensive diseases and
heart failures without any significant symptoms over many years. In this project we will propose and
design an idea of a system which can help people and doctor have a better way to check their and
patient’s health status. Our system help nurses measure patient’s blood pressure and heart rate
remotely or they can schedule a device to run the measuring procedure at a specific time. This will
help them to reduce their time and effort in a large hospital. This system may help to reduce
white-coat effect as doctor/nurse don’t need to see the patient in person when they want to measure
patient’s blood pressure.
